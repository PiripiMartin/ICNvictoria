ICN Database Design Documentation

OVERVIEW

The ICN (Industrial Capability Network) Database is a normalized relational database designed to store and manage information about industrial organizations, their capabilities, items, and geographical locations. The database contains 2,840 organizations with geocoded coordinates across Australia, organized into 4 main tables with proper foreign key relationships.

DATABASE ARCHITECTURE

The database follows Third Normal Form (3NF) principles to eliminate data redundancy and ensure data integrity. All tables use camelCase naming conventions and are designed for optimal performance with appropriate indexing.

Key Statistics:
- 28 unique item categories
- 51 detailed item specifications  
- 51 industry sectors
- 2,840 organizations with coordinates
- 87% geocoding success rate

TABLE STRUCTURE

1. Items Table
Purpose: Stores high-level item categories and types

Columns:
- itemId (VARCHAR 50, Primary Key): Unique identifier like ITM-002348
- itemName (VARCHAR 255): Descriptive name like "instrumentation"

Contains 28 unique items representing major equipment and service categories.

2. DetailedItems Table  
Purpose: Stores specific detailed descriptions of items with relationships to parent items

Columns:
- detailedItemId (VARCHAR 50, Primary Key): Unique identifier like DITM-000530
- detailedItemName (VARCHAR 500): Specific description like "Process control & instrumentation (PLC/SCADA)"
- itemId (VARCHAR 50, Foreign Key): Links to parent item category

Contains 51 unique detailed items providing granular capability descriptions.

3. Sectors Table
Purpose: Stores industry sector classifications

Columns:
- sectorMappingId (VARCHAR 50, Primary Key): Unique identifier like SM-000524
- sectorName (VARCHAR 255): Industry sector name like "Critical Minerals"

Contains 51 unique sectors representing different industry classifications.

4. Organisations Table
Purpose: Central table storing all organization information with geographical coordinates

Key Columns:
- organisationId (VARCHAR 50, Primary Key): Unique organization identifier
- itemId (VARCHAR 50, Foreign Key): Links to Items table
- detailedItemId (VARCHAR 50, Foreign Key): Links to DetailedItems table
- organisationCapability (VARCHAR 50): Organization capability code
- organisationName (VARCHAR 500): Full organization name
- capabilityType (VARCHAR 100): Type like "Supplier" or "Manufacturer"
- validationDate (DATE): When information was last validated
- billingStreet (VARCHAR 500): Street address
- billingCity (VARCHAR 255): City name
- billingStateProvince (VARCHAR 100): State or province
- billingZipPostalCode (VARCHAR 20): Postal code
- sectorMappingId (VARCHAR 50, Foreign Key): Links to Sectors table
- formattedAddress (VARCHAR 1000): Complete formatted address
- latitude (DECIMAL 10,8): Geographic latitude coordinate
- longitude (DECIMAL 11,8): Geographic longitude coordinate

Contains 2,840 organizations with complete address and coordinate information.

RELATIONSHIPS

The database uses a hub-and-spoke model with the Organisations table at the center:

- Organisations connects to Items via itemId foreign key
- Organisations connects to DetailedItems via detailedItemId foreign key  
- Organisations connects to Sectors via sectorMappingId foreign key
- DetailedItems connects to Items via itemId foreign key

This structure allows for:
- One organization can have one item category and one detailed item specification
- One item category can have multiple detailed items
- One sector can contain multiple organizations
- Complete traceability from organization to high-level categories

GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE

Coordinate System: WGS84 decimal degrees with 8 decimal place precision
Coverage Area: Primarily Australian addresses across all states and territories
Address Types: Street addresses, industrial complexes, unit numbers, PO boxes

State Distribution:
- Victoria (VIC): Largest representation
- New South Wales (NSW): Second largest
- Queensland (QLD): Significant presence
- Western Australia (WA): Good coverage
- South Australia (SA): Moderate coverage
- Tasmania (TAS), Northern Territory (NT), Australian Capital Territory (ACT): Smaller representation

DATA PROCESSING

Source Data: Original dataset contained 20,486 rows from alldata.csv

Processing Pipeline:
1. Geocoding Process: Used OpenStreetMap Nominatim API to convert addresses to coordinates
2. Data Cleaning: Removed invalid records and handled missing organization IDs
3. Normalization: Extracted unique values and created foreign key relationships
4. Quality Assurance: Validated coordinate ranges and data consistency

Final Result: 2,840 organizations with valid coordinates and complete relationship mapping

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

Indexing Strategy:
- Primary key indexes on all tables
- Foreign key indexes for join performance
- Geographic index on latitude/longitude for spatial queries
- Search indexes on commonly queried fields like city and state

Query Performance: Optimized for common operations including:
- Finding organizations by item category
- Geographic proximity searches
- Sector-based filtering
- Multi-table joins across all relationships

COMMON USE CASES

Business Intelligence:
- Analyze supplier distribution by geography
- Identify capability gaps in specific regions
- Track industry sector concentrations
- Monitor validation dates for data freshness

Operational Queries:
- Find all suppliers of specific equipment types
- Locate organizations within geographic radius
- Generate reports by state or sector
- Export data for mapping applications

Geographic Analysis:
- Plot organization locations on maps
- Calculate distances between suppliers
- Identify regional clusters
- Support logistics and supply chain planning

DATA QUALITY

Completeness: 100% for all required fields in final dataset
Accuracy: 87% successful geocoding rate with street-level precision
Consistency: Normalized structure eliminates data redundancy
Timeliness: Validation dates tracked per organization record

Quality Measures:
- Automated validation of coordinate ranges
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- Data type enforcement ensures consistency
- Regular validation against source systems recommended

DEPLOYMENT INFORMATION

Generated Files:
- database_schema.sql: Complete table creation statements with indexes
- database_inserts.sql: All data insertion statements (2,981 lines)
- Normalized CSV files: Individual table exports for analysis

System Requirements:
- Database server supporting ANSI SQL
- UTF-8 character encoding support
- Minimum 100MB storage space
- DECIMAL data type support for coordinates

Maintenance Recommendations:
- Regular backups due to geocoded coordinate value
- Index maintenance for optimal query performance
